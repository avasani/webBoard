Abstract -

This project is to meet the necessary requirements of online lectures and to
make it easier for the instructors and the students to communicate more
effectively and interactively, especially for remote students. WebBoard is an
integrated tutoring application. During the presentation, the instructor can
write on the application interface called WebBoard, the content of which is
replicated to all the students in their WebBoards. It comes with a Question &
Answer feature which allows students to ask questions in a manner that can
be accessed by students participating in the class. The instructor can easily
switch among the slides, video and the WebBoard. While elaborating on the
concepts, the instructor can annotate the content of slides, without modifying
them which makes it easier for students to understand the concepts. The
lectures are recorded in the class rooms and are available to all the students
later on the cloud.
